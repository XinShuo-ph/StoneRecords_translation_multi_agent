# Cultural Context - 红楼梦 Translation Reference

## Historical Setting

### The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912)

红楼梦 was written during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (乾隆, r. 1735-1796), at the height of Qing prosperity. Key aspects:

- **Manchu Rule**: The Qing were Manchus, not Han Chinese. This created cultural tensions.
- **Banner System**: Hereditary military organization; the Jia family are banner nobility
- **Peak Prosperity**: The story depicts aristocratic life at its most extravagant
- **Hidden Critique**: Cao Xueqin encoded criticism of his era through the novel

### Cao Xueqin's Background

- **Cao Family**: Formerly wealthy bannermen who served the Kangxi Emperor
- **Family Decline**: Lost favor around 1728; confiscated properties
- **Autobiographical Elements**: Many see the Jia family as reflecting Cao's own family
- **Dates**: c. 1715-1763 (or later)
