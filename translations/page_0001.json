    "红楼梦 (Dream of the Red Chamber) is one of China's Four Great Classical Novels, written by Cao Xueqin (ca. 1715-1763) during the Qing Dynasty",
    "脂评 refers to the Zhiping Commentary attributed to 脂砚斋 (Zhiyan Zhai, 'Rouge Inkstone Studio'), a commentator whose identity remains unknown but who was clearly intimate with the author and the real events behind the novel",
    "This 汇校本 (collated edition) compiles commentary from multiple early manuscript sources including the 甲戌本 (Jiaxu, 1754), 庚辰本 (Gengchen, 1760), and 己卯本 (Jimao, 1759)",
    "The work is the authentic 80-chapter version by Cao Xueqin, NOT the later 120-chapter Cheng-Gao continuation",
    "Kolistan is the modern editor who compiled this digital edition with bookmarks and cross-referenced commentary sources"

  "research_notes": [

    "Reviewed academic consensus on manuscript sources and dating",
    "Checked standard translations: Hawkes uses 'Story of the Stone', Yang uses 'Dream of Red Mansions' - we adopt 'Dream of the Red Chamber' as most widely recognized",
    "Confirmed that 脂砚斋 identity remains scholarly debate, likely a close relative or intimate friend of Cao Xueqin"
